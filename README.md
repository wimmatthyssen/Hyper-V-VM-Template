# Hyper-V-VM-Template

This repository contains PowerShell scripts used to automate and ease up a Hyper-V VM template creation process. 

First of all to save time, but also to reduce errors and to ensure consistency by eliminating the need for repetitive configuration changes and performance tweaks.

Because I do a lot of research and testing, and therefore use a lot of different virtual machines (VM), which get build and rebuild, I mostly deploy them from a pre-configured template (base image or golden image).

Currenently this repository holds the following PowerShell scritps:

Template_Customization_Windows_Server_2016_2019; BgInfo_Automated_Windows_Server_2012_R2; BgInfo_Automated_Windows_Server_2016_2019_2022
